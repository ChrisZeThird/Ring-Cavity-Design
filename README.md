# Ring-Cavity-Design
This repo simulates cavity geometries and nonlinear crystals to optimize SHG &amp; OPO setups. It estimates the optimal waist in the crystal, poling, folding angle, and cavity stability. Features include Gaussian beam propagation, phase matching, and stability analysis for various mirror and crystal configurations.
